The repository contains the following self written implementations as a part of the Game Theory and Mechanism Design MiniProject:
    a. Probabilistic Serial algorithm: probabilistic_serial.py
    b. Recursive Probabilistic Serial (RPS) algorithm: Recursive_Prob_Serial.py

The RPS alogorithm makes use of the Barkhoff von Neumann decomposition, the implementation of which has been borrowed from https://github.com/jfinkels/birkhoff and is named here as bvn.py
